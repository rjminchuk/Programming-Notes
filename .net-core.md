# .Net Core Notes

## .Net Core vs Desktop .Net Framework

> VS Code does not support debugging applications running on the Desktop .NET Framework.
> Due to this focus, many standard C# project types are not recognized by VS Code. 
> An example of a non-supported project type is an ASP.NET MVC Application (though 
> ASP.NET Core is supported). In these cases, if you simply want to have a lightweight 
> tool to edit a file - VS Code has you covered. If you want the best possible experience 
> for those projects and development on Windows in general, we recommend you use Visual 
> Studio Community.

## .Net Standard

[.Net Standard](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/09/26/introducing-net-standard/) is a set of APIs 
that all .NET platforms have to implement. This unifies the .NET platforms and prevents future fragmentation.

## Migrating from project.json to project.csproj for MSBuild
> The dotnet migrate command will migrate a valid Preview 2 project.json based project 
> to a valid Preview 4 csproj project. By default, the command will migrate the root 
> project and any project references that the root project contains. This behavior can 
> be disabled using the --skip-project-references option at runtime. 
> [More info here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/preview3/tools/dotnet-migrate)
