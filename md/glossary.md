## Software Platforms

Term | Description

`.Net Core`, `.Net Core Runtime` | a general purpose development platform maintained by Microsoft and the .NET community on GitHub. It is cross-platform, supporting Windows, macOS and Linux, and can be used in device, cloud, and embedded/IoT scenarios.
`.Net Framework`, `Desktop .Net Framework`, IE: `.Net 4.X` | A programming infrastructure created by Microsoft for building, deploying, and running applications and services that use .NET technologies, such as desktop applications and Web services. The .NET Framework contains three major parts: the `Common Language Runtime`, the `Framework Class Library`, `ASP.NET`.
`ASP.Net Core` | ASP.NET Core is a lean and composable framework for building web and cloud applications. It is different than `ASP.Net` in that it relies on the `.NET Core` runtime.
`ASP.Net` | A Microsoft server-side Web technology. ASP.NET takes an object-oriented programming approach to Web page execution. Every element in an ASP.NET page is treated as an object and run on the server. An ASP.NET page gets compiled into an intermediate language by a .NET Common Language Runtime-compliant compiler. Then a JIT compiler turns the intermediate code to native machine code, and that machine code is eventually run on the processor.
`.Net Standard` [.Net Standard](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/09/26/introducing-net-standard/) | is a set of APIs that all .NET platforms have to implement. This unifies the .NET platforms and prevents future fragmentation in frameworks like .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin
