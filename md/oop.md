# OOP Concepts

#### Frameworks VS Design Pattern
- I like to think of new development as an opportunity to build a framework for interaction between different software layers, using design patterns as the structure of how each layer will interact with one another layer.
- A framework dictates how to use itself, while a design pattern is used to develop the framework.

#### Abstract Classes
- An abstract class might be used to represent the similarities between two different concrete classes.
- An abstract class cannot be instatiated but it's members may be implemented and extended.

#### Interfaces
- An interface can be used to represent similar functionalities across concrete classes that are very much dissimilar.
- An interface can be inherited.

#### Factories
- A factory can be used to limit the instantiation of an object to one place in code.
