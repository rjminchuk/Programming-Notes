# .Net Core Notes

## Getting Started with ASP.Net Core (MacOS)
1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and its [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp).
2. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) from VSCode's terminal. Brew is a Package Manager for MacOS that can install neat and necessary things.
3. Go to [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#macos) for explicit additional brew commnads for setup.
4. Exec Brew setup commands obtained from step 2. ASP.Net Core requires OpenSSL to work. these steps ensure it's installed properly. You can pretty much forget about `Brew` now.
5. Download and install .Net Core from [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#macos).
6. `npm` is the NodeJS Package Manager. It's obviously bundled with NodeJS. Install it. [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
7. Install Bower using npm. `npm install -g bower`
8. Let's make a web app. `mkdir ~/Source/first-web-app`
9. Explicitly open the folder we created in VSCode. `File > Open Folder`
10. Exec `dotnet new -t web` in VSCode Terminal. The `-t` option specifies the type of app we want to create. In this case a web app.
    - Eventually VSCode will ask you if you want to add launch configuration files. `click yes` 
11. Exec `dotnet restore` in VSCode Terminal.
12. Open `bower.json` to view what JS dependencies Microsoft thinks it should install by default for you, then restore those dependencies by executing `bower install`
13. Exec `dotnet build`
14. Hit `fn + F5` to debug.

## .Net Core vs Desktop .Net Framework

> VS Code does not support debugging applications running on the Desktop .NET Framework.
> An example of a non-supported project type is an ASP.NET MVC Application (though ASP.NET Core is supported).

## .Net Standard

> [.Net Standard](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/09/26/introducing-net-standard/) is a set of APIs
> that all .NET platforms have to implement. This unifies the .NET platforms and prevents future fragmentation 
> in frameworks like .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin

## Migrating from project.json to project.csproj for MSBuild
> The dotnet migrate command will migrate a valid Preview 2 
> project.json based project to a valid Preview 4 csproj project. 
> [More info here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/preview3/tools/dotnet-migrate)

<!-- ## Getting Started with .Net Core (Windows 10)

1. To setup your development machine download and install `.NET Core` and `Visual Studio Code` with the `C# extension`.
