# .Net Core Notes

## .Net Core vs Desktop .Net Framework

> VS Code does not support debugging applications running on the Desktop .NET Framework.
> An example of a non-supported project type is an ASP.NET MVC Application (though ASP.NET Core is supported).

## .Net Standard

> [.Net Standard](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/09/26/introducing-net-standard/) is a set of APIs
> that all .NET platforms have to implement. This unifies the .NET platforms and prevents future fragmentation 
> in frameworks like .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin

## Migrating from project.json to project.csproj for MSBuild
> The dotnet migrate command will migrate a valid Preview 2 
> project.json based project to a valid Preview 4 csproj project. 
> [More info here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/preview3/tools/dotnet-migrate)
