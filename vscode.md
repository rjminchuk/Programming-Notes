## Basic Usage

### .Net Core vs Desktop .Net Framework

> VS Code does not support debugging applications running on the Desktop .NET Framework.
> Due to this focus, many standard C# project types are not recognized by VS Code. 
> An example of a non-supported project type is an ASP.NET MVC Application (though 
> ASP.NET Core is supported). In these cases, if you simply want to have a lightweight 
> tool to edit a file - VS Code has you covered. If you want the best possible experience 
> for those projects and development on Windows in general, we recommend you use Visual 
> Studio Community.
